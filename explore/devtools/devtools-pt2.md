1. What was the bug?
   >The bug is that we read the two numbers input as string,
   when we are add to string, we just concatenate them.
    But we want to add them as numbers. Which gives us the wrong answer.

2. How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use)
   >We can fix it by using Number() to convert the string to number.\
   In this case, we can deal with both integer and float numbers.\
   refer to fix.png.
